# misaligned-text

a way to reproduce the touching degree of human error i keep seeing in window treatments with vinyl lettering

## thinking

was thinking about this concept for a while

& how re-creating it programatically removes some of what i like

& how maybe it ought to only ever be recreated on some span-by-span styling type shit

to truly be in the same spirit

either way

it's fun to play with
